# Bot_Beeper
Bot made for my family's Discord server to learn how to make Discord bots in Python.

In order to get this working for your own bot, you need the following:
- **SECRETS** to be set up in your Replit (Mine are noticeable through the CONSTANT synstax in `__main__.py`
- **Packages**:
    - hikari
    - hikari-lightbulb
    - Flask
- **Ensure** that you `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` contains this line:
    - `python = ">=3.8,<3.11"`
